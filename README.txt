with your friends and family. It is a standalone (Java) application that 
 * Reads photographs and GPS track files
 * Assigns each image a GPS location (based on its timestamp)
 * Allows you to annotate each photo with a title and description text
 * Exports annotated images and GPS tracks for each day to a single, 
   compact KMZ file that can be viewed in Google Earth
